This folder contains the binaries and exe I generated. You can test this on your system (Windows 7 64-bit).
Usage:

open cmd, run the following command:

OpenPose.exe facedetectionpotw_01.png 0

(please note that '0' at the end of above command is the gpuid on my system. You can check your gpuid on your system using nvidia-smi command for Nvidia GPU's)
